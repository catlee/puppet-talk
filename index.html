        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            Chris AtLee &lt;catlee@mozilla.com&gt;<br/>
            Release Engineering Manager at Mozilla.<br/>

            <p>My group is responsible for all the continuous build
            integration infrastructure for Firefox development as well
            as the release infrastructure. We have over a
            thousand machines, and are doing nearly 2,000 builds of
            Firefox along with almost 20,000 test jobs a day.</p>

            <p>I work with John O'Duinn who spoke to some of you earlier about
            our release process.  We like to share what we've learned about
            release engineering, and this presentation part of that. We'd love
            to hear what things you've learned too!</p>

        <h3>What is puppet?</h3>
        <div class="build">
        <span>
        puppet is an open-source configuration management system that
        allows you to manage:
        <ul>
            <li>installed software</li>
            <li>running services</li>
            <li>user accounts</li>
            <li>cron jobs</li>
            <li>&amp; anything else that can be scripted</li>
        </ul>
        </span>
        
        <p>It uses a simple declarative language to describe the desired
        state of your systems.</p>

        <p>It runs well on Linux and OSX.</p>

        <p>Windows support is under development.</p>
        </div>

      <article>
        <h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
        <div class="build">
            <p>Do you enjoy deploying new cron jobs to dozens of
            machines via ssh? (mozilla releng has done this)</p>
            <p>Do you like rebuilding production machines from
            outdated documentation on a wiki somewhere? (we've done
            this too)</p>
            <h4>No?</h4>
            <p>puppet allows you to manage all of your systems
            from a central location.</p>
            <p>you control when updates are deployed.</p>
            <p>guaranteed consistency.</p>
            <p>un-doing of local changes (it's not a bug...it's a
            feature!)</p>
            <p>reproducibility - your manifests become the de-facto
            recipe for how to (re-)create the environment.</p>

        <h3>How does Mozilla use it?</h3>
        <p>
        Release Engineering manages over a thousand machines for our continuous
        build &amp; release infrastructure on a mix of Linux, OSX, Windows and
        mobile devices. It's simply impossible to manage this many machines
        manually. We were failing horribly when we had just a fraction of our
        current capacity due to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Human error</li>
          <li>Copy/paste fail</li>
          <li>Machines being offline when maintenance being performed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Other groups inside Mozilla such as IT also use puppet.

      <h3>Today in RelEng</h3>
      We now use puppet to
      <ul class="build">
        <li>manage our linux and OSX build and test slaves (hundreds of these).
            <ul>
                <li>Deploy new compilers</li>
                <li>Ensure system services like screensavers are disabled</li>
                <li>We run puppet once on boot and wait for it to complete before starting the buildbot slave</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>manage buildbot masters (dozens of these)</p>
            <p>These used to be set up manually. Only a handful of them, so what's the big deal?</p>
            <ul class="build">
                <li>No naming consistency. Depending on who set it up a master could be in <code>/builds/buildbot/build_master</code>, <code>/builds/buildbot/build_master1</code> or <code>/builds/buildbot/build-master</code></li>
                <li>Missing cronjobs, init.d entries, nagios checks. It can take a while to discover these problems!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>almost every new client or server deployment is done now with puppet</li>

        <h3>Declarative language</h3>
        <p>puppet manifests describe the expected state of the system,
        <strong>not</strong> how to get there. Contrast this with
        imperative systems where configuration is deployed as a series
        of changes.</p>
        <p>
        With imperative systems, how do you know what your
        last state of your machine was? How do you cope with machines
        that are in various states of "up-to-date"-ness?</p>
        <p>A lot of that
        problem is pushed down to the administrator to develop smarter
        deployment scripts to test the state of the machine. It's
        often very different deploying a change onto a freshly imaged
        system than an old crufty system that has been running for
        months or years.</p>
        <p>One of the nice things about puppet is that its language is
        declarative: you describe the end state of the system, and
        puppet figures out what needs to happen to get you there.</p>
        <div class="build"><p><br/>Anybody else here deployed software via ssh and a for loop?</p></div>

      <article>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        At the lowest level, puppet manages a set of "resources" for
        each system. The node definition and any included classes or
        defines describe what resources are available on a system.
        <pre># demo1.pp
package {
    "apache2":
        ensure =&gt; latest;
}
service {
    "apache2":
        require =&gt; Package["apache2"],
        enable =&gt; true,
        ensure =&gt; running;
}
</pre>
        This manifest ensures that the "apache2" package is installed,
        and that the "apache2" service is enabled (starts on boot), and
        is running. The service depends on the package, since you
        can't start running apache without first installing it!
      </article>
      <article>
      <h3>Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
      puppet has several ways to describe dependencies between
      different resources.
      </p>
      <dl>
      <dt>require</dt><dd>we've seen this before - the required resource must
        be satisfied before this one is checked</dd>
      <dt>before</dt><dd>opposite of require - this resource must be satisfied
        first</dd>
      <dt>subscribe</dt><dd>like require, but refreshes if the dependency
        changes. Useful for services.</dd>
      <dt>notify</dt><dd>opposite of subscribe</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Note the different syntax for referring to an already declared
      resource: <code>Package['apache2']</code> vs declaring a resource:
      <code>package {"apache2": ...}</code></p>
      </article>
      <article class="smaller">
      <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>
        classes are a way of grouping sets of related
        resources together so they can be reused elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't think object-oriented-programming classes. Think "roles"
        instead.
        </p>
        <p>
        classes are singletons - there can only be one instance of a class on a
        given node. Nodes "include" them to declare that all of the resources
        defined in the classes should be applied to the node.
        </p>
        <pre style="height:300px; overflow:scroll;"># demo2.pp
class ntp {
    package {
        "ntp":
            ensure =&gt; latest;
    }
    service {
        "ntp":
            require =&gt; Package['ntp'],
            enable =&gt; true,
            ensure =&gt; running;
    }
    file {
        "/etc/ntp.conf":
            source =&gt; "/vagrant/ntp.conf",
            mode =&gt; 644,
            notify =&gt; Service["ntp"];
    }
}

class apache {
    package {
        "apache2":
            ensure =&gt; latest;
    }

    service {
        "apache2":
            require =&gt; Package["apache2"],
            enable =&gt; true,
            ensure =&gt; running;
    }
}

    include apache
    include ntp
}

      <article class="smaller">
      <h3>Resource definitions</h3>
      <p>If you need more than one instance of a thing on a node, you
      should use custom resource definitions. These custom resource
      types then become usable just like native types such as
      "package", "exec", and "service".
      <pre style="height:400px; overflow:scroll;"># demo3.pp
# Basic class to get the require packages we need installed
class git {
    package {
        "git-core":
            ensure =&gt; latest;
    }
}

# Use define to create a new resource type
define git::repo($remote_repo) {
    # We need the git packages
    include git

    exec { 
        # $name is a special variable that refers to the name given to this
        # resource where it's instantiated
        $name:
            require =&gt; Class['git'], # Can't run this without git itself!
            command =&gt; "/usr/bin/git clone $remote_repo $name",
            creates =&gt; $name;
    }
}

# Now we can use this resource type like any other native type
# Clone the puppet-talk repo to /root/puppet-talk
node "lucid32" {
    git::repo {
        "/root/puppet-talk":  # this is $name
            remote_repo =&gt; "git://github.com/catlee/puppet-talk.git";
        "/root/buildbot":     # so is this
            remote_repo =&gt; "git://github.com/catlee/buildbot.git";
    }
}
</pre>
      </article>
      <article class="smaller">
        <h3>Templates</h3>
        puppet supports the ERB template language (also used by ruby on rails) to support content generated at runtime. A simple example of this is with the file resource:
        <pre style="height:400px; overflow:scroll;"># demo4.pp
class ntp {
    package {
        "ntp":
            ensure =&gt; latest;
    }
    service {
        "ntp":
            require =&gt; Package['ntp'],
            enable =&gt; true,
            ensure =&gt; running;
    }
    file {
        "/etc/ntp.conf":
            content =&gt; template("/vagrant/ntp.conf.erb"),
            mode =&gt; 644,
            notify =&gt; Service["ntp"];
    }
}

$servers = ["ntp.mydomain.com", "ntp2.mydomain.com"]
include ntp

      <article>
        <h3>Modules</h3>
        Classes, defines, files and templates can (and should!) be packaged up into modules.
        A module is a simple directory structure under the server's module path.
        <pre class="noprettyprint">
/modulepath/modulename/manifests/init.pp
/modulepath/modulename/files/
/modulepath/modulename/templates/</pre>
        puppet automatically searches for modules when including classes or using resource types.
        <pre> include foo </pre>
        will include class 'foo' from /modulepath/foo/manifests/init.pp if it hasn't been declared already.
